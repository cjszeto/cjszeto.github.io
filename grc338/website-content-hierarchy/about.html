                <h2>The Philz Story</h2>
                    <p class="about-text"> Founded by Phil Jaber in San Francisco's Mission District, Philz has always had one goal in mind: to better the days of everyone who walked in.

                <h3>Made in the Mission</h3>
                    <p>It all began in 1978 when Phil purchased a convenience store in the heart of the Mission District. He treated his customers with niceness and respect, always paying attention to their needs. He understood that if you put people first, you cannot fail. </p>
                    <p>In his off-hours, Phil blended and tested brews trying to make the perfect cup of coffee. After 25 years of experimentation Philmoved his kitchen table into the convenience store and Philz Coffee was born. From his first day, Philz was about quality and care, warmth and connection.</p>
                    <p>This is what makes Philz feel like home. It's not just about the coffee â€”its about the people.</p>
