                    <h2>Made in Noe Valley</h2>
                        <p>It all began in 2021 when Chloe purchased a convenience store in the heart of the Noe Valley District. He treated his customers with niceness and respect, always paying attention to their needs. She understood that if you put people first, you cannot fail. </p>
                        <p>In her off-hours, Chloe blended and tested brews trying to make the perfect cup of coffee. After coming home from college she began to start her new adventure and dive into the world of coffee. </p>
