                            <h2>Find the right plants for every space in your home.</h2>
                    
                                <p>Greenery has set roots in every home design setup, and the fact doesn’t surprise us. With so many varieties (hybrids included) available on the market, you can easily find the ones that suit your home orientation, decor, air quality, and budget. And you don’t even need a green thumb! The best plants for every room in your home are, at the same time, low-maintenance varieties that perfectly fit every lifestyle. And all levels of gardening expertise, too.</p>

                            <h3>
                                Enterance
                            </h3>   
                                <p>Who better to greet you and your guests than rich and showy begonias? The easy-to-care-for Begonia semperflorens will be happy even on a shelf in the shade of a moderately lit foyer. This annual doesn’t require much space nor expects direct sunlight and prefers a temperature range of 58-72°F.
                                <p> It will reward you with bright, soft flowers and vividly green foliage as long as you don’t overwater it. On average, water your begonias once every four days. The only challenge remains the fact they are available in over two thousand varieties. Look for wax begonia and new hybrid varieties to narrow down the choice.</p>  
                            <h3>
                                Living Room</h3>
                                <p>The living room deserves a centerpiece that will be as inviting as it is comforting. If you don’t mind sharing the spotlight, place a couple of orchids near your window. These tropical plants with long-lasting flowers expect more light, so open the curtains and let the sunshine in. They will thrive if the air is humid, so bear this in mind if you live in a dry climate and keep your air humidifiers on.</p>
                                <p>Some of the plants that fit every living room design are also great attention grabbers. Fiddle leaf fig, Ficus Benjamina, Philodendron, and Rubber tree plant are all known to easily adapt to available light conditions, require watering once a week, and grow in height. If your living room is facing south and basks in direct sunlight, a Bird of Paradise will love it!</p>

                                <h3>Adaption to Seasons</h3>

                                <p>How seasons affect plants depends on whether the plant is native to the area or not. Strong seasons will affect tropical plants more intensely and the other way round. How do plants know this? The amount of sunlight changes over the year due to the tilt of the planet. Plants recognize this change during the winter months and adapt to it by shedding their leaves and soaking less water. If you want to provide optimal growth conditions all year long to your indoor plants, bask them in the right kind of light, one they can use for photosynthesis. The so-called grow lights are the solution and come in three varieties: LED lights, fluorescent lights, and High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) lights.</p>

                                <p>Also, the frequency of watering will vary depending on the plant variety, your climate, and season. Most watering recommendations refer to average amounts and frequency to encompass most varieties of the same species. A good rule of a (green) thumb is to halve this watering period during hot and dry months and double it during the cold and humid season.</p>

                                Home Office</h3>
                                <p>With the growing need for home office space arose the need for improving this room’s aesthetic and comfort. Peace lily, Dracaena, and Parlour Palm will all look good as a background for your Zoom calls and purify the air in your home office. As well as Parlour Palm, Peacy lily prefers bright indirect sunlight, moist but well-drained soil, and some liquid fertilizer every two weeks during spring and summer.</p>
                    
                                <p>Dracaena easily adapts to various light conditions and is very simple to grow indoors. As long as you water it properly by allowing it to drain well between waterings, it will thrive in the corner of your home office. If you have kept your dracaena in a garden, you can easily propagate it and grow new plants from stem cuttings. This is very important if you’re leaving a house for an apartment and can’t bring all your plants with you.</p>

                            <h3>Bedrooms</h3>
                                <p>A bedroom is a place for most welcome respite, and even more so if it hosts a fragrant French lavender. This variety is known for its aromatherapy features, and it is best suited for growing indoors. Just like in Provence, it thrives in the sun. A south-facing window will be the ideal spot and a quick-draining pot a perfect home.</p>
                                <p>If you prefer a plant that will grow in medium, indirect light, a colorful Snake plant will fulfill your expectations. It doesn’t take much space, as it grows in height. Watering monthly will suffice. And most importantly, it removes toxins from the air even during the night.</p>
                            <h3>Kid's Rooms</h3>
                                <p>Yes, it is possible to grow plants even in your little one’s room. Taking care of low-maintenance, soft, colorful, and non-toxic succulents can serve as a simple, fun, and stress-free lesson in responsibility and horticulture.

                                    Succulents will forgive you if you don’t water them for a month, but they do love exposure to bright light. Keep them close to the window, and don’t worry; if they start to wither, simply water them, and they will spring back to life.</p>

                                    You know how helpful indoor plants can be for your health. But while you have potted myriad plants in and around your house, you may still be in two minds about keeping a few plants in your bedroom, probably because you are worried that bedroom plants can be harmful at night as they emit carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen. However, research suggests that the carbon dioxide released by plants is too less to be harmful to humans and the oxygen they absorb is pretty minuscule. On the contrary, plants help you sleep better, suppress airborne germs, release water vapor, and remove indoor pollutants and chemicals from the air. So here are the 9 plants that help you sleep better every night.

                                <p>
                                    Drying flowers for the purpose of preservation has been around since ancient times. In fact, there's evidence of preserving blooms dating back all the way to the Egyptians who used them to decorate tombs. Not only do dried flowers create a beautiful decoration, but they can also serve as a meaningful keepsake—a way to cherish a wedding bouquet or boutonniere for years to come. "The process of drying flowers involves transitioning them from a fresh lithe state of being to a brittle state of permanence," explains Ashley Greer, owner of Atelier Ashley Flowers. In other words, to dry flowers is to let all of the water evaporate.
