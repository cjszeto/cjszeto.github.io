                                    Low-light conditions are always a challenge for the indoor gardener. Even plants that do well in outdoor shade tend to need more light when grown indoors, and this can be hard to come by unless you provide auxiliary lighting. But all is not lost.

Do not wait to see if symptoms appear because in some cases of poisoning, by the time symptoms appear, it's too late to save the animal.These flowers contain lycorine, a chemical compound that triggers vomiting.

                                    Cacti are some of my favorite types of plants to grow inside all year, and outside in summer. Unfortunately, the ambient air tends to stay moist during most seasons, a condition which makes cacti unhappy. Cactus potting soil can enhance drainage.
