Balconies are an important part of urban environments as they allow for relaxed, alfresco style living, so it makes sense to celebrate this area and give it the attention and styling it deserves.

                                    Low-light conditions are always a challenge for the indoor gardener. Even plants that do well in outdoor shade tend to need more light when grown indoors, and this can be hard to come by unless you provide auxiliary lighting. But all is not lost. Some houseplant species positively thrive in low-light conditions.

                                    An increasing number of people are bringing plants into their homes. While research suggests that plants are capable of purifying the air, this is not the main reason that they are entering homes. The simple fact is that plants are pretty. Even on a cold winter’s day, it can be pleasant to see a plant n your living space, especially if it has dark green leaves and perhaps a stunning flower growing at the top of it.

                                    Cacti are some of my favorite types of plants to grow inside all year, and outside in summer. Unfortunately, the ambient air tends to stay moist during most seasons, a condition which makes cacti unhappy. Cactus potting soil can enhance drainage, increase evaporation and provide the dry conditions that cacti favor. What is cactus mix? This medium promotes optimum health for your cactus and mimics the natural gritty, arid and low nutrient soils they grow in naturally. You can purchase the mixture or learn how to make cactus soil yourself.

But instead of constantly buying new plants, many plant parents try their luck with propagating their houseplants by themselves because they actually enjoy the process of doing so and love to see new plant babies come to life!

Not only can they beautify a room, but they can also purify the air of toxins and produce nighttime oxygen, freshening the bedroom for sounder sleep.

                                <p>
                                    Drying flowers for the purpose of preservation has been around since ancient times. In fact, there's evidence of preserving blooms dating back all the way to the Egyptians who used them to decorate tombs. Not only do dried flowers create a beautiful decoration, but they can also serve as a meaningful keepsake—a way to cherish a wedding bouquet or boutonniere for years to come. "The process of drying flowers involves transitioning them from a fresh lithe state of being to a brittle state of permanence," explains Ashley Greer, owner of Atelier Ashley Flowers. In other words, to dry flowers is to let all of the water evaporate.
